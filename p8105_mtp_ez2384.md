### Problem 1: Data Import and Cleaning

##### \[Discussion\] Description and Processing of Raw Datasets

- `NYC_Rental_Price Dataset`
  - Description: contain detailed NYC Rental Prices between Jan.2015 to
    Aug.2024 listed by zip codes  
  - Dimension: 149 x 125  
  - Issues:
    - ambiguous column names
      - Column name `RegionName` actually consists entirely of zipcode
        information, which is very misleading.  
      - Column names of form `X2015.1.31` should be renamed for better
        readability.  
    - redundant columns
      - Column `RegionID` is useless as we can treat the zipcode
        variable as the unique identifier.
      - The entire dataset is within NYC so columns `StateName`,
        `State`, `City`, `Metro` can be removed.
      - Column `SizeRank` is never used for future analysis.
      - Column `RegionType` has only 1 level of value and is useless.
    - too much missing data  
  - Data Cleaning Strategy:
    - Rename and Keep only the following columns: `county`, `zipcode`,
      and all date columns of form `%yyyy%mm%dd`.
    - Remove records containing empty values.
- `NYC_Zipcode Dataset`
  - Description: contain detailed zipcode-location associations within
    NYC  
  - Dimension: 322 x 7  
  - Issues:
    - redundant columns
      - Only column `County`, `ZipCode`, `Neighborhood` is useful.
  - Data Cleaning Strategy:
    - Rename and Keep only columns `county` and `zipcode`.
    - Also per instruction required, add `borough` variable.
- `US_Housing_Price Dataset`
  - Description: contains detailed housing prices information within
    entire U.S. associated with specific area  
  - Dimension: 26338 x 21  
  - Issues:
    - ambiguous columns
      - Column name `RegionName` actually consists entirely of zipcode
        information, which is very misleading.
      - Column names of form `X2015.1.31` should be renamed for better
        readability.  
    - redundant columns
      - Only zipcodes, State, and date columns are used in future
        analysis.  
    - missing data
  - Data Cleaning Strategy:
    - Rename and Keep only variables `zipcode`, `state`, and all date
      columns of form `%yyyy%mm%dd`.
    - Remove records containing empty values.

##### \[Code Chunk\] Raw Data Cleaning

``` r
  NYC_Rental_Price = NYC_Rental_Price %>% janitor::clean_names() %>% select(-region_id, -size_rank, -region_type, -state_name, -state, -city, -metro) %>%
                     rename("zipcode"="region_name", "county"="county_name") %>% mutate(county=gsub(" County","",county)) %>% mutate(across(where(is.numeric), \(x) round(x, 2))) %>%
                     drop_na() %>% arrange(zipcode)
                     colnames(NYC_Rental_Price)[3:ncol(NYC_Rental_Price)] <- colnames(NYC_Rental_Price)[3:ncol(NYC_Rental_Price)] %>% sub("x", "", .) %>% gsub("_", "/", .) %>%
                                                                             sub("(\\d{4})/(\\d{1})/(\\d{2})", "\\1/0\\2/\\3", .)
                     
  NYC_Zipcode = NYC_Zipcode %>% janitor::clean_names() %>% select(county, zip_code, neighborhood) %>% rename("zipcode"="zip_code") %>% relocate(zipcode) %>% drop_na() %>%
                mutate(borough=recode(county, "Kings"="Brooklyn", "New York"="Manhattan", "Richmond"="Staten Island"))
  
  US_Housing_Price = US_Housing_Price %>% janitor::clean_names() %>% select(region_name, state, starts_with("x")) %>% rename("zipcode"="region_name") %>% drop_na() %>% arrange(zipcode)
                     colnames(US_Housing_Price)[3:ncol(US_Housing_Price)] <- colnames(US_Housing_Price)[3:ncol(US_Housing_Price)] %>% sub("x", "", .) %>% gsub("_", "/", .) %>%
                                                                             sub("(\\d{4})/(\\d{1})/(\\d{2})", "\\1/0\\2/\\3", .)
```

##### \[Code Chunk\] Merge NYC_Rental and NYC_Zipcode Datasets

``` r
  Merged = left_join(x=NYC_Zipcode, y=NYC_Rental_Price, by="zipcode") %>% rename("county"="county.x") %>% select(-county.y) %>% relocate(zipcode, borough, county, neighborhood) %>% drop_na()
```

##### \[Discussion\] Merged Datasets, Issues, Fixing

- The merged dataset has several issues, firstly there are many missing
  values under the county column from the `NYC_Rental_Price` dataset, so
  we drop `county.y` as all information is available in `county.y`. The
  merged dataset has no missing values for the character variables
  `zipcode`, `borough`, `county` but has plenty of missing values for
  the numeric ones. Remove records containing empty values.

##### Discussion on TIDYed Dataset

- `NYC_Rental_Price` Dataset
  - Dimension: 48 x 118
- `NYC_Zipcode` Dataset
  - Dimension: 180 x 4
- `US_Housing_Price` Dataset
  - Dimension 25811 x 14
- The merged `Merged` Dataset
  - Dimension 48 x 120
  - Unique Zipcodes: 47
  - Unique Neighborhoods: 19
