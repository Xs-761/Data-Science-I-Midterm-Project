###### Problem1 Discussion

- When merging datasets, warning message appears: Detected an unexpected
  many-to-many relationship between x and y variables, implying
  “zipcode” is not unique in `NYC_Zipcode` dataset.  
- Upon checking, zipcode all unique in `NYC_Rental_Price` and
  `NYC_Housing Price`, but contain duplicate values 10463 and 11201 in
  `NYC_Zipcode`. Remove incorrect records.  
- Upon removal of incorrect observations, the join was performed
  successfully with the resulting `Merged` dataset.
- Description on the `Merged` dataset:
  - Dimension: 17455 x 6.  
  - Unique Zipcodes Included: 320  
  - Unique Neighborhood Include: 43  
- Data Manipulation
  - In both `NYC_Rental_Price` and `US_Housing_Price` datasets, changed
    `RegionName` to `zipcode`.  
  - Converted `NYC_Rental_Price` and `NYC_Rental_Price` to a longer
    format with all date variables listed under column `date` and values
    listed under column `rental_price` and `housing_price`,
    respectively.  
  - Redundant Column Names
    - In `NYC_Zipcode` dataset, I kept only the `zipcode`, `county`,
      `borough`, `neighborhood` columns.  
    - In `NYC_Rental_Price` dataset, I kept only the `zipcode`,
      `county`, `date`, `rental_price` columns.  
    - In `US_Housing_Price` dataset, I kept only the `zipcode`, `city`,
      `state`, `housing_price` columns.

##### **Tables**

```

###### Problem2 Discussion

- Month Discrepancy
  - Some months do not have meaningful research values for collection.
  - Decided not to include some Months as the rental prices data are too
    incomplete within this period.  
- Zipcode Discrepancy
  - `NYC_Rental_Price` dataset has 149 but `NYC_Zipcode` dataset has 320
    zipcodes is because it is not necessary to include rental price data
    for every single zipcode within NYC.  
- Tabe:

- Remarks on Table1
  - Across most boroughs, rental prices has a general increasing trend
    over year 2015-2024.  
  - Manhattan has the highest rental prices among all boroughs, with
    prices rising from 3022.04 in 2015 to 4078.44 in 2024.  
  - For Staten Island, the data is missing from 2015 to 2019. From 2020
    onward, values are recorded.  
  - Price variation between boroughs is significant: Manhattan
    consistenty has the highest rental prices while the Staten Island
    has the lowest prices(for available years).  
- The following is a selection of Table2 giving a comparison of rental
  prices in Jan.2021 to rental prices in Jan.2020:

- Remarks on Table2
  - For most zipcodes, rental prices decreased from Jan.2020 to
    Jan.2021.  
- The following Table3 gives the largest drop in price from Jan.2020 to
  Jan.2021 with neighborhoods included:

| borough   | neighborhood        | Jan.2020 | Jan.2021 |   drop |
|:----------|:--------------------|---------:|---------:|-------:|
| Bronx     | Southeast Bronx     |  1922.05 |  1905.59 |  16.46 |

| Queens    | West Central Queens |  2509.86 |  2292.88 | 216.98 |

- Remarks on Table3
  - For all available boroughs and among those neighborhoods with the
    highest price drop from Jan.2020 to Jan.2021, `Lower Manhattan` has
    the largest price decrease of `$912.60` and `Southeast Bronx` has
    the least price decrease of `$16.46`.  
  - Rental prices in Bronx as a whole did not drop significantly between
    Jan.2020 to Jan.2021.  
  - Staten Island data in both Jan.2020 and Jan.2021 are unavailable for
    analysis.
